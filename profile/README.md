# Open Source Cloud

A community-driven organization focused on building open-source cloud infrastructure and services.

## Mission

Our mission is to develop high-quality, open-source cloud services for companies and developers, providing freedom from dependency on proprietary cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. We aim to create cutting-edge technology and foster innovation in the cloud computing space.

## Focus Areas

- Cloud-native infrastructure
- Distributed systems
- Containerization and orchestration
- Storage solutions
- Networking tools
- Security frameworks
- Developer tooling

## Technology

Our primary development language is Go (Golang), chosen for its performance, simplicity, and excellent support for concurrent systems. We also welcome contributions in:

- C
- C++
- Rust

(Javascript sucks >:))

These languages are particularly valuable for performance-critical components.

## Projects

Our repository houses various cloud infrastructure projects aimed at providing robust alternatives to proprietary cloud services.
